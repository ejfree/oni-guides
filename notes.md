# Notes

These are just some rough notes for myself.

# Early Game

- **Roll dupes**
  - Digger
  - Researcher
  - Rancher (or Builder / Digger / etc)
- **Set schedules**
  - Leave default with nobody in it (helpful for later to see which dupes are new, and might not be "set up")
  - Remove bathtime
  - Setup each schedule with ~3 downtime (increase in late game), then 2 sleep time (2 is enough, they will sleep until no longer tired regardless)
  - Make ~6 schedules with this setup offset from each other
    - Keep no more than 4 dupes in each schedule
    - The point of this is primarily to offset bathroom usage, so you can support a large number of dupes on 4 bathrooms
- **Set priorities**
  - _(Warning: I'm playing around with these, this setup could be terrible)_
  - Default:
    - No cooking, decorating, farming, ranching
  - Diggers:
    - +1 attack, build, dig
  - Researchers:
    - +2 research
    - +1 operate
    - -1 build, dig (except in early game)
  - Ranchers:
    - +2 ranching
    - +1 farming, operating
  - Cook:
    - Prioritize getting 1 cook in your first couple of dupes.
    - Not super important what their skills are, ideally just not bad culinary traits.
  - Decorator:
    - Mid/Late game look for a decorator.
    - Do NOT enable any decoration tasks until they can make masterworks (best decorating skill), then decor bomb everywhere with statues/paintings
  - General:
    - Can sort of help with everything: attack, build, dig, supply, tidy, etc.
  - Operator:
    - High operating skills, you want quite a few of these in the late game to get things done faster.
    - Mid game you want at least 1 with mechatronics engineering to build conveyors/solid transports
- **Day 1:**
  - Build outhouse + wash basin, somewhere
  - Build ~4 cots in a ROOM (for morale)
  - Build research station
  - Dig to water and put a pitcher pump in it
- **Early game goals:**
  - Set up vacuum food storage
  - Set up a bathroom loop
  - Set up carbon skimmer loop
  - Get some planters/food going of some sort
  - Get some refined materials from rock crusher
  - Start clearing out and insulating your core base area (insulate earlier on more harsh worlds)
  - Coal generator + smart battery hookup at the bottom of your base
  - Set up mess hall
- **Mid game goals:**
  - Get plastic/steel
  - Set up SPOM
  - Set up active cooling
  - Set up hatch ranches  
  - Decor bomb everywhere, get morale high
  - Get rooms setup (pips to make a nature reserve in main ladder-way)
  - _todo: add more goals_
- **Late game goals:**
  - _todo: add more goals_

## Let's Start At the Beginning

ONI is first a survival game, then a building game, then colony management, finally it is about managing large, complex projects. Oh, and you still have to do all the other things, like survive. You will learn that many things that mattered early in the game simply don't anymore at cycle 100 or 1000.

So, first, only play on terra & easy mode until you get a feel for the game. With these setting you have the most chance at success in the early part of the game surviving. Surviving allows you to actually learn how to play & git gud.

I divide the game into the following phases. Once you pass specific milestones you move into the next phase. The nature of the game often changes at these milestones.

- Beginning - this is start until you begin to define the structure of your base. Probably only lasts 10-15 cycles. Plan & think in sub-cycle timeframes. Focus on immediate survival needs.

- Early Game - This is when you start to build your initial base blocks. Start thinking  in a structured format and in cycle time frames. Increasing food stability, O2 generation, & power generation are the main focus.

- Manufacturing - Here you should have contained your initial base in insulated tiles. You should have a fully sustainable base with regards to oxygen, food, & power. You should be starting to make steel. Dups will spend lots of time in atmo suits. You now should have “large construction projects."

- Petroleum - You have mastered the petroleum biome meaning that you are creating plastic constantly, can generate as much power as necessary, and have complete control of your environmentals especially temperature

- Space - to infinity & beyond.

## Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs - Beginning

There are a lot of problems in ONI that you have to solve. In the beginning, your problems are pretty simple. *Sleep, Eat & Breath*

1. Shelter/Base - You probably figured out the cots and latrines already. But you need to start thinking LONG term on how to structure things. First, while it may not look like it, you have a TON of space to work with. Use it. Also, you will find that it is much easier as the game progresses to keep things fairly standard. 4x16 or 4x24 rooms that stack up & down. between these blocks I have 5 spaces (though 3 is also ok).

    4x16 Block |WALL| - space - ladder - tube - fire pole - space - |WALL| 4x24 block

2. Oxygen - You will have tons of algae. Use it for diffusers. Don't build an electrolyzer early, you don't need it and it will add heat to your base. You can use diffusers for a long time.

3. Power - Initially this is manual generators. Stay on this as long as you can. Once you have some constant power draws, like liquid pumps, you will need to move to coal. Once you make this change, you need to push as quickly as possible to Smart Batteries so you can ensure you don't waste power & resources.

4. Food - You will have enough muckroot & nutrient bars to survive. Your first research should be towards planters & farm tiles. Mealwood is the only good early food sources. You need 4 mealwood/dup approximately. Just eat it plain as there is no reason to waste the effort to process it. Watch your calories like a hawk. And the most important tip for the beginning. *Do NOT add dups until you are food positive.*

5. Plumbing - Find some water. Put a pitcher pump in it. then start to gather all the water on your map into some reservoirs. Always put a top/cover/lid on your reservoir so crap doesn’t fall into it. Learn to build natural reservoirs and do it frequently as you expand. Soon you will have lots of them all pumping around to each other. Eventually you will have a main clean water tank, a few backup tanks, and large reservoirs of other various liquids.

Slow and steady is now the key to beating the game. Every save, probably daily, develop a routine of things to check. Then you can go focus on building something new. That will ensure you dont get surprised. Once you are food positive and have a good hang for the game, you are ready to tackle the [Early Game.](./meta-guides/early.md)
